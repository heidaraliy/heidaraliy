- 👋 Hi, I’m hida.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, automation, and machine learning, along with blockchain engineering and design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Solidity, Java at college, and Solidity when I have free time to poke around.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects, I'm fairly new to programming and engineering, but hungry for more, as usual.
