hi, it's me! i like to build web apps and audio-related programs. i typically write stuff in C++ and TypeScript, although i tend to be a little adventurous -- software is pretty fun to learn!
<br>
<br>
i'm currently working on [SilkForest](silkforest.xyz) -- i want to give back to the audio engineering community by building some cool ambient, explorative audio plugins. i've modeled these after my own sound, and i'd like to think that some of the functionalities stand out a bit over your typical DAW plugins. these plugins are all free, and there'll always be a free version of each plugin, so please give them a shot -- hope you enjoy!
