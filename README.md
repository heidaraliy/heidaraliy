- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Heidar.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation and machine learning, and I really like experimenting with financial systems and exchange APIs, and I'm working on incorporating the two through quantitative analysis and statistical approaches to trading. I also really like front-end engineering and website design, I've built a couple of websites using React and Tailwind CSS.
- ðŸŒ± So many languages to learn, it's hard to pick. Java will always be a favorite of mine because I began learning it first, but JavaScript and Python are a lot easier to get into and build with. While continuing to build my knowledge base in these languages, I'm also trying to learn SQL as well as Rust (just dabbling).
Aside from this, I also like to dabble in Solidity, it's similar to Java so I can understand it and I like the simplicity of it.
